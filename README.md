## User Stories

User story 1:
As a time-pressed user
So that I can quickly go to web sites I regularly visit
I would like to see a list of bookmarks



## Connecting to psql
1. Connect to `psql`
2. Create the database using the `psql` command `CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;`
3. Connect to the database using the `pqsl` command `\c bookmark_manager;`
4. Run the query we have saved in the file `01_create_bookmarks_table.sql`
